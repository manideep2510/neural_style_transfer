## About
This the implementation of the paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a>" in Pytorch following a <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-advanced-neural-style-tutorial-py">tutorial</a> in official Pytorch documentation.

## Files

- **images** - Style and Content images
- **neural_style_transfer.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with all the code for the style transfer algorithm.
- **resize.py** - This script can be used to resize the images and save them in a folder (already created) by editing few lines in the script.
