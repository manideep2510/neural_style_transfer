## Files

1. **images** - Style and Content images
2. **neural_style_transfer.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with all the code for the style transfer algorithm.
3. **resize.py** - This script can be used to resize the images and save them in a folder (already created) by editing few lines in the script.
